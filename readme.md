## Basic Overview
The purpose of the experiment was to measure the diameter of the pupil of the human eye, which varied depending on the images presented to those taking part in the experiment. It is assumed that with scenes that are drastic the diameter increases. Data was collected using an eyetracker that tracked the gaze of the test subjects.

Using MATLAB functions, the luminescence of the images presented, that is, the amount of light generated, was also calculated.

The results confirm that the largest pupil occurred at image number 4, which presented dramatic scenes and had the lowest luminescence.
